# AssistedSpectralRebalancePlugin
<b>
This was my Final Year Project for university, and it involved 6 months of research, programming and learning. It's the first audio plug-in I created on my own and it was built with C++, using the JUCE framework.
<br><br>
This plug-in rebalances the spectrum of a piece of audio by comparing and matching it with a suitable reference provided by the user. It can be useful in cases where there are multiple vocal takes in a mixing session, recorded in different conditions (different preamp, different mic, distance to the mic or even the tilt of the mic) but the mixing engineer needs the spectral characteristics to be consistent across the entire performance.
